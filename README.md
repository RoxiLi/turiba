A mobile application that provides information about natural tourist sites and suggests tourist routes. It is needed that when the user is in a perimeter near a tourist site, information can be displayed with augmented reality and with the help of geolocation. In order for the application to suggest routes to the user, it is necessary to implement collaborative filters.
